## Description

This application helps users that need to keep track of a lot of information. It's easy to forget details or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

```
AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes
I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```
